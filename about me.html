                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I have experienced various phases in my career, all of which have had an impact on my current work in hardware and software.

                        I enhanced my leadership skills by participating in scouting during my junior and senior high school years, and now I can apply these experiences in my daily life.
                        
                        I enjoy playing games such as League of Legends, action games, and puzzle-solving games, as well as watching movies, particularly those in the action and romance genres. I also have a fondness for spicy foods.
                        
                        I currently reside in Angeles City, but I was born on August 19, 2003, in San Luis, Pampanga
